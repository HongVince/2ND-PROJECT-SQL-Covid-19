# Findings and Observations

    Dataset: https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths 
    Years Covered: 2020-2023

## Synopsis
In this project, I collect Covid-19 data from Our World in Data to export into SQL for analysis. After demonstrating my ability to develop CTEs, Temp Tables and Views, I export my findings into Tableau for visualization and further analysis. 

## Some Key Points
The vaccination percentage of a continent's population 
The contraction percentage of a continent's population
The liklihood of death by country
The infection rates of a country's population
Death count by country
Death count by continent
A high level look at the global statistics

## Analysis
Despite having a lower contraction rate, Mexico's mortality rate seems to surpass, China, India, the United States and the United Kingddom. This may be attributed to Mexico's Safe Distance campaign having an impact in reducing the contraction rate, but not impacting the proportion of hospitalized and deceased patients. 

Futhermore, another reason could be the saturation of hospital and intensive care units required to deal with the high occupancy of patients. This would exist in both private and public institutions.
