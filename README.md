# Findings and Observations

    Dataset: https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths 
    Years Covered: 2020-2023

## Synopsis
In this project, I collect Covid-19 data from Our World in Data to export into SQL for analysis. After demonstrating my ability to develop CTEs, Temp Tables and Views, I export my findings into Tableau for visualization and further analysis. 

## Some Key Points
- The vaccination percentage of a continent's population 
- The contraction percentage of a continent's population
- The liklihood of death by country
- The infection rates of a country's population
- Death count by country
- Death count by continent
- A high level look at the global statistics

## High Level Findings
Despite having a lower contraction rate, Mexico's mortality rate seems to surpass, China, India, the United States and the United Kingddom. This may be attributed to Mexico's Safe Distance campaign having an impact in reducing the contraction rate, but not impacting the proportion of hospitalized and deceased patients.
Futhermore, another reason could be the saturation of hospital and intensive care units required to deal with the high occupancy of patients. This would exist in both private and public institutions. 

The U.S.'s contraction rate as well as death count seem to be overshadow a lot of other wealthy countries. This may be attributed to the U.S.'s difficulity in distributing vaccinations in parts of the country for one reason another. A big factor in this issue is the politiciziation of the public health's response to the pandemic.
Futhermore, the U.S's resistance to the public health's response might have a large role in the high contraction and mortality rates. When considering the population size of the U.S, the statistics are astonishing.

Despite having the highest infection rates, Europe's death count and average percentage of death is lower than that of the American continent. Many factors may have influenced such a result, but the prominent culprit seems to be the population's perception of the public health's response to Covid-19. Despite being hit hard early on, isolation efforts enabled countries like France and Austria (two European contries with the higehst infection rates) to hold off death rates until the release of vaccinations. Furthermore, there seems to be a trend regarding a populations perception of the public health's efforts in dealing with the epidemic. 

In summary, despite being patient zero, China's average death rate/count is lower than the U.S. This is attributed to China having a faster reaction time, naturally. All this to say, North America's higher death count seems to correlate with the politiciziation of the epidemic. More specifically, the public health's preventative measures like masks and vaccinations. All in all, the epidemic is highly contreversial in the states, for unforseen reasons.
